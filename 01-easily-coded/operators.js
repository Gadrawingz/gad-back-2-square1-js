// An operand: is what operators are applied to. 
// UNARY: An operator is unary if it has a single operand. 
// For example: The unary negation - reverses the sign of a number:
let posNumber = 30;
let negNumber = -posNumber;
document.write('<br>', negNumber)

// An operator is binary if it has two operands. 
// The same minus exists in binary form as well:
let x = 30, y = -10
document.write('<br>', x - y)
