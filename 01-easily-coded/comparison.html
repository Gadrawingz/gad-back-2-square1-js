// Comparison
// 1. Boolean is the result;
// true: means “yes”, “correct” or “the truth”.
// false: means “no”, “wrong” or “not the truth”.
let result1;
let a = 3;
let b = 60;
let c = 40;

result1 = a > b
document.write("<br>", result1); // false
document.write("<br>", b != c); // true

// String comparison
// To compare strings, JS uses the so-called “dictionary” or “lexicographical” order.
// Means that strings are compared letter-by-letter.
let letterK = 'K'
let letterC = 'C'
let letterZ = 'Z'
document.write("<hr>", letterC > 'B'); // true
document.write("<br>", letterZ != 'N'); // false
document.write("<br>", letterZ < 'P'); // true


/*
The algorithm to compare two strings is simple:
-----------------------------------------------
1. Compare the first character of both strings.
2. If the first character from the first string is greater (or less) than the other string’s, then the first string is greater (or less) than the second. We’re done.
3. Otherwise, if both strings’ first characters are the same, 
compare the second characters the same way.
4. Repeat until the end of either string.
5. If both strings end at the same length, then they are equal. 
Otherwise, the longer string is greater.
*/

document.write("<br>", "FLOOR" > "FLOOD"); // true
/*
6. Here we go:
This comparison needs more steps as strings are compared character-by-character:
F is the same as F.
L is the same as L.
O is the same as O
O is the same as O
R is greater than D
Stop here. The first string is greater.
*/


document.write("<hr>", 'A' == 'a'); // false
document.write("<br>", "L" != "l"); // true
document.write("<br>", "m" > "M"); // true
document.write("<br>", "d" < "D"); // false
/* 
Comparison is not based on real dictionary, but Unicode order.
For instance, case matters. 
A capital letter "A" is not equal to the lowercase "a". 
Which one is greater? The lowercase "a". 
Why? Because the lowercase character has a greater index in the internal encoding table JavaScript uses (Unicode)
*/

// Comparison of different types
// When comparing values of different types, JS converts the values to numbers.
document.write("<br>", "2" < 2); // false
document.write("<br>", "03" > 1); // false // 03 becomes 3

// For boolean values, true becomes 1 and false becomes 0.
document.write("<br>", true < 1); // false
document.write("<br>", false == 0); // false
