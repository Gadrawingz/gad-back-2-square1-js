/*
OR "||" finds the first truthy value
-------------------------------------
The extended algorithm works as follows.
The OR || operator does the following:

1. Evaluates operands from left to right.

2. For each operand, converts it to boolean. If the result is 
true, stops and returns the original value of that operand.

3. If all operands have been evaluated (i.e. all were false), returns the last operand.

= A value is returned in its original form, without the conversion.
= In other words, a chain of OR || returns the first truthy value 
or the last one if no truthy value is found.
*/
document.write(`${ null || 1 }<br>`); // 1 is the 1st truthy value
document.write(`${ null || 0 || 1 }<br>`); 
// 1 is the 1st truthy value
document.write(`${ null || 0 || undefined || 1 }<hr>`); 
// all falsy, returns the last value

// Getting the 1st truthy value from a list of variables/expressions
let firstName = "";
let lastName = "";
let nickName = "SuperNinja"; // If Blank, it will show Anonymous
let theName= firstName || lastName || nickName || "Anonymous";
// I have firstName, lastName and nickName variables, 
// all optional (i.e. can be undefined or have falsy values).
// OR(||) will choose the one that has the data and show it 
// (or "Anonymous" if nothing set):
document.write(`${ theName }<hr>`);
