// Copying an obj variable creates 1 more ref to the same object.
// How about duplicating object?
// We can create a new object and replicate the structure of 
// the existing one, by iterating over its properties and copying 
// them on the primitive level.

let developer = {
    username : "Gadev",
    realAge: 89,

// The new empty obj
let clone = {};

// To copy all dev properties into it...

// After that... clone is a fully independent object with 
// the same content
document.write(clone.username+" has site called: "+clone.website);
// Gadev has site called: donnekt.com
document.write("<br>");
document.write(developer.username+" is "+clone.realAge+" years old!");
// Gadev is 89 years old!

// Because each object is independent... i can change the data in it.
// but it will not affect the data in the original object
